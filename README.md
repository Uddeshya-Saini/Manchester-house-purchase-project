In this project, my goal was to find an ideal area in Manchester to purchase a house. To determine the best location, I considered several factors, including proximity to an Outstanding-rated school, distance to the office, noise levels, and average house price. Utilising SQL, I categorised each area into buckets using NTILE based on distance to the office and average house price. Additionally, I assigned a value of 1 to areas with an outstanding school and 0 to those without. While I was unable to quantify noise levels for each area, I used a weighted average method to assess these factors for different areas in Manchester and ultimately made an informed decision.

I undertook this project as part of a recruitment process for a company, which provided me with a budget of Â£350,000 and told me to consider that I have a 12 year old child. Although I aspired to include additional factors such as crime levels, cost of living, and availability of green spaces, I encountered limited data on these aspects. Nonetheless, within this portfolio, you will find the presentation I created along with a CSV file containing the rankings for each area and their corresponding weighted averages.
